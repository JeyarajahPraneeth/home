				<p>
					Ilex Forest is a forest located left of Azalea Town, but before you enter, you will have another encounter with your rival, 
					and this time, he is a lot stronger.
				</p>
			<!-- Table for the Pokemon the rival will have -->
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Pokemon</th>
						<th>Type</th>
						<th>Level</th>

						<td>Gastly</td>

					After beating him, you will go into the forest, where you will encounter a charcoal maker's son, who has lost his Farfetch'd. 
					After chasing it down, you will be rewarded HM01 (Cut), which will allow you to progress further into the forest. You can also 
					find the TM for Headbutt in the center of the forest, and this will allow you to find Pokemon in "headbutt trees", with some 
					Pokemon only being found in headbutt trees. Travel north through Route 34 to make it to Goldenrod City.

			<h2>Goldenrod City Gym</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The gym leader of Goldenrod City is Bugsy, who specializes in normal-type Pokemon. Her Miltank is very powerful and can destroy your 
				team if it uses rollout, which scales in damage if continuously used. Fighting types will destroy her team though, and an easy fighting
				type to pick up is a Machop, which you can find on the fifth floor of the Goldenrod Department Store (the large building where you can buy
				a lot of items). If you catch a Hypno on Route 34, you can trade for the Machop. No matter which starter you picked, this gym will be 
				difficult.
