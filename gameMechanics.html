				<h2>Stats</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					There are 6 main stats that your Pokemon have: Health, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense,
					and Speed. Health is the total amount of hit points your Pokemon has before they faint, Attack and Special
					Attack are the amount of power your moves will do, and Defense and Special Defense are the amounts of damage 
					for the opposing Pokemon that will be negated. Speed will dictate which Pokemon attacks first. These stats 
					will increase throughout the game via levelling up your Pokemon.
				</p>
				<img src="images/evolution.jpg" height="250" alt="Pidgey's Evolution">
				<h3>Leveling and Evolving</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Levelling up is a process in which your Pokemon earns experience points, and becomes stronger. Pokemon can level up
					to level 100, and Pokemon get more powerful as they level up. You will learn new moves as you evolve as well. After
					getting to a certain level, certain Pokemon will evolve, changing into another Pokemon. This would be called its 
					evolution, and many Pokemon have evolutions. These evolutions are more powerful versions of the pre-evolved Pokemon.
					All the Pokemon stats will increase as well.

			<h2>Battling</h2>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/battleMenu.jpg" height="250" alt="Battle Menu">
			<h3>Battling Mechanics</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The goal of a Pokemon battle is to defeat all the opponent's Pokemon. During a battle, you are given 4 options: Fight, Bag, 
				Pokemon, and Run. After defeating a Pokemon, you get experience. This experience can be used to level up your Pokemon and 
				unlock more moves, as well as increase your stats.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Fight</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Choosing the fight option will allow you to attack with any of your 4 moves (if you don't yet have 4 moves, you will just 
				have the number of moves you have unlocked. If you cannot use any of your moves, you will use struggle, a move that inflicts
				damage to the opponent but also to yourself.
			</p>
			<h5>Moves</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>
				There are 3 types of moves, Special, Physical, and Status. Special and Physical moves inflict damage, while Status 
				moves to inflict a status effect (anything from putting the Pokemon to sleep or lowering its attack). A move being 
				special or physical depends on its typing. Special moves use your special attack stat to calculate the amount of 
				damage you do, and the opposing Pokemon's special defence. Physical moves do the same but with the attack and defence 
				stats. All moves have power points (PP), which is the number of times you can use a move. Power points will rest back 
				to full after healing at a Pokemon Center, or with the use of Elixer (an item). PP will not be restored by potions or 
				other methods of healing.
			</p>
			<h4>Bag</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The Bag allows you to access items, which you can use in battle.The Bag allows you to access items, which you can 
				use in battle.
			</p>
			<h4>Pokemon</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The Pokemon section allows you to access the other Pokemon on your team (max of 6 Pokemon at all times), and switch between
				them in battle. If any of your Pokemon gets low, you can switch to another Pokemon to help you.
			</p>
			<h4>Run</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				This allows you to leave the battle (only wild encounters). If your Pokemon are too slow or under-levelled, you may need 
				to try multiple times until you can escape the battle. You cannot run from trainer battles.
			</p>
			<h3>Type Of Battles</h3>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/wildEncounter.jpg" height="250" alt="Wild Encounter">
			<h4>Wild Encounters</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Wild Pokemon encounters often occur in the grass, water, or caves, and are battles with wild Pokemon. These Pokemon 
				can be caught using Pokeballs or can be defeated for the experience. Most wild Pokemon are weak and are not much of
				a challenge. You'll want to catch some of these Pokemon to help you throughout the game.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="images/trainerBattle.jpg" height="250" alt="Trainer Battle">
			<h4>Trainer Battles</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Trainer Battles are more difficult battles and will reward you with double the experience, making them a great way
				to level up your Pokemon. Most trainer battles are also quite easy, but there is a special class of trainers, 
				known as Gym Leaders. There are 8 gym leaders in every region, and they specialize in a particular type. These 
				battles can be quite difficult. To progress in the game, you need to collect gym badges, which are available in most 
				town gyms. They also allow you to use certain HMs, which are required to advance in the game.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<div class="alternateBackground">
				<hr>
				<img src="images/item.jpg" height="250" alt="Items">
				<h2>Items</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Items are objects that you can pick up throughout the game. They are stored in your bag, and certain items can 
					even be used to aid you in battle. Medicines will either heal you up a certain amount of HP points, remove status 
					conditions, revive fainted Pokemon, or restore power points on moves. Berries can be found on berry bushes and will 
					have certain effects depending on the berry. Key Items are key to progress in the game, and are also very useful, 
					like the bicycle. HMs and TMs allow your Pokemon to learn moves without levelling up, and HMs can even be used 
					outside of battles to help you clear obstacles, and are also required to progress through the game. For more 
					information, click <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Item">here</a>.

			<h2>Types</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Types are a property that applies to both the Pokemon, and their moves. Pokemon typing will affect how effective the 
				opposing Pokemon attack is. The Pokemon's attack can have a different type to the Pokemon itself, but when a Pokemon 
				uses the same type of attack, they get the same-type attack boost (STAB), which makes the attack do 1.5x more damage. 
				Typing also affects if the attack is physical or special, and therefore if it depends on your attack and defence, or your 
				special attack or special defence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is a type chart of how each type matches up with each other. The attacking side is vertical and the 
				defending side is horizontal.
