				<h2>Ruins Of Alph</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					After defeating Falkner, travel south toward Route 32, where you can go into the Ruins of Alph. Ruins of Alph is not a 
					mandatory place to visit, but it is the only place where you can find unown, a special Pokemon with 28 forms. But you 
					will need to solve puzzles to unlock the ability to find Unown.

			<h2>Union Cave</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Head south down Route 32. Route 32 has some great Pokemon which become very powerful later on in the game, like Mareep and Wooper. 
				You will definitely want to catch them. Continuing south, you will reach Union Cave. There are plenty of cave-dwelling Pokemon to 
				find and trainers to fight in Union Cave. You can even find a Lapras every Friday, but not until later in the game. You can also 
				find plenty of rock types, which you will want to catch as the next gym leader is a bug-type leader. It is a great place to grind 
				for experience and level up.

				<h2>Slowpoke Well</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					After going through Route 33, you will arrive in Azalea Town. But the entire town will be infested with slowpoke, so you 
					won't be able to battle the gym leader. You will need to visit Kurt, whose house is in the northern part of Azalea Town. He will
					ask you to go down to Slowpoke Well. There, you will encounter Team Rocket, an evil organization, who are selling slowpoke tails. 
					After battling through the grunts, you will be able to go to the Azalea Gym Challenge.

			<h2>Azalea City Gym</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The gym leader of Azalea City is Bugsy, who specializes in bug-type Pokemon. Cyndaquil (or Quilava if you have evolved it),
				is amazing against Bugsy's team, while once again Chikorita (or Bayleef) struggles. Rock, fire, or flying types will be good 
				against Busgy's team, and rock types are abundant in Union Cave, so you should definitely catch one if you need to. Bugsy does 
				have a very powerful Scyther though, which can be hard to defeat even with a type advantage, and it is very fast. You 
				will want to have a team-level average of about 15.
