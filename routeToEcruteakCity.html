				<hr>
				<ul>
					<li>
						After getting the third gym badge, head northeast, to the flower shop. There, you can get a squirtbottle, 
						which is a key item you need to get passed a path-blocking Sudowoodo. After heading north from Goldenrod 
						towards Route 35, you will reach the national park. If you go on certain days, you can participate in the 
						bug-catching contest, where you can catch rare bug Pokemon and win rewards. After heading east from there 
						towards Route 36, you will eventually encounter the path blocking Sudowoodo. Using the squirtbottle will 
						cause you to battle it, and after defeating it, you can continue north towards Route 37, to Ecruteak City.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you go inside the Pokemon center, you can take to Bill, the creator of the Pokemon storage system, and 
						if you head back to his house in Goldenrod afterwards, he will give you an Eevee, but that is optional. But 
						you need to go to the Ecruteak dance theatre, where you will find the kimono girls. Defeating them will result 
						in you getting HM03, which you will need later in the game.

			<h2>Burned Tower</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				It is said that in the past, this tower used to be called the brass tower, and was as tall as the bell tower, another 
				tower in Ecruteak. But after it was hit by lightning, it burned and is now in the state it is in. If you go in, you 
				will have another rival battle with your rival. After that, if you go downstairs, you will find three Pokemon, who 
				will run away right after.

				<h2>Ecruteak City Gym</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The gym leader of Ecruteak City is Morty, who specializes in ghost-type pokemon, though his entire team 
					also has poison typing. His gengar is very powerful and can put your Pokemon to sleep, so make sure to 
					buy plenty of awakenings. You may want to catch psychic types like Drowzee in nearby Routes, though his 
					ghost-type attacks will be super effective against you. Make sure to use Pokemon with moves that are not 
					normal types, and you may even want to evolve that Eevee into an Umbreon (increase its friendship at night
					by levelling it up, giving it a haircut in Goldenrod, and walking with it).
